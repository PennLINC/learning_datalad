* DataLad tutorials - follow it and learn! (Sydney recommends it - where can i find it?)

For FAIRly big workflow:
* [GitHub repo](https://github.com/psychoinformatics-de/fairly-big-processing-workflow) of example FAIRly big workflow bootstrap scripts

    * See [FAIRly_big](FAIRly_big) for more explanations.

Be sure:
